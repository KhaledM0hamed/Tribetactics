>“I think I have satisfied all requirements, I will 
be happy to have a discussion about anything in the
project and all different options that may satisfy
any part of the project, As I know it could be 
better from the perspective of security and API or
test coverage but due to the lack of time I made 
sure to implement the requirements only.“
